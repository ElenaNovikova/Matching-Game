## About the project

The Matching/Memory Game Project is a complete browser-based card matching game, also known as Concentration game. It is a complex web application, that combines student's skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a relatively large project.

## How to play

The game board consists of sixteen virtual cards. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different images on one side. The cards are arranged randomly, with the image face down. The player must flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Browser compatibility

Application supports the majority of modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
